# Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope

###Summary

In first year, we were given a challenge to design and build a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) with limited parts and limited guidance. This challenge was comprised of multiple steps, including:

 -Planning and creating a vibration isolation system to dampen ambient micro- and nano-scale vibrations to allow for less noisy measurements
 -Taking advantage of redox reactions to create a tungsten tip for the STM which is sharp on the nano-scale
 -Using CAD software to model the STM setup
 -Conducting tests to obtain the surface topography of a CD
 -Data analysis using MATLAB to view the results

Overall, we were awarded best design and our group was the only one able to actually obtain somewhat clear data.


###Vibration isolation


When creating a vibration isolation system, we were only allowed to use a small variety of parts due to the nature of the design challenge. We were allowed to use acrylic plates (which could be laser-cut to our specifications) as well as a handful of tension springs and a very small selection of compression springs. We also used rubber strips and hot glue. Without the restraints on building materials our design would have differed greatly, but we had to make do. In the end, our design worked very well and was able to quickly dampen even massive vibrations, as shown in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzelec5LNmc){target="_blank"} (which will open in a new tab).
