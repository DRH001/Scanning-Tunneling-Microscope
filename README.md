# Scanning-Tunneling-Microscope

Summary
=

In first year, we were given a challenge to design and build a Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) with limited parts and limited guidance. This challenge was comprised of multiple steps, including:

 -Planning and creating a vibration isolation system to dampen ambient micro- and nano-scale vibrations to allow for less noisy measurements
 -Taking advantage of redox reactions to create a tungsten tip for the STM which is sharp on the nano-scale
 -Using CAD software to model the STM setup
 -Conducting tests to obtain the surface topography of a CD
 -Data analysis using MATLAB to view the results

Overall, we were awarded best design and our group was the only one able to actually obtain somewhat clear data, as shown in the photo below. In this photo, all the axes are in nanometers. Sinusoidal noise is very evident in this data, likely due to the AC signal used in the STM setup.

Vibration isolation

When creating a vibration isolation system, we were only allowed to use a small variety of parts due to the nature of the design challenge. We were allowed to use acrylic plates (which could be laser-cut to our specifications) as well as a handful of tension springs and a very small selection of compression springs. We also used rubber strips and hot glue. Without the restraints on building materials our design would have differed greatly, but we had to make do. In the end, our design worked very well and was able to quickly dampen even massive vibrations, as shown in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xzelec5LNmc">this video</a>.

Creating the STM tip
=

To create our STM tip, we placed a tungsten anode and a graphite cathode partially submerged in a NaOH solution and used a redox reaction to slowly ionize the tungsten, which would then be depositen onto the graphite in its redox reaction. After a period of time, the tungsten inside the solution was very thin at the meniscus but not so thin everywhere else. Eventually, the portion of tungsten submerged in the solution fell off due to the portion at the meniscus being too thin to support the weight of the submerged portion. The tungsten which was not submerged was then removed and analyzed, and was sharp on the nanoscale (see the following photo).
